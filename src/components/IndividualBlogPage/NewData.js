           paras:["It was a momentous decision when I, Satish, along with my friends, Sekhar, and Naveen, chose to become entrepreneurs. We decided to embark on the road less travelled and carve out our own destiny. It was a journey of sweat, tears, and determination.","In 2016, I was struck with an idea to provide a platform for skilled individuals to use their skills and earn money. I discussed it with Sekhar, and we started developing the concept. With no team, no funding, and no concrete idea, we had to start from scratch. We learned and researched everything we could to build the platform ourselves. Being electronics background students, we had other projects to work on, which delayed the start of our venture.","In 2018, I joined TCS, but the idea never left my mind. In 2019, we picked it up again after experimenting with IoT projects. However, finding the right team member was a challenge. We tried reaching out to contacts from our previous workshops but to no avail. We had to learn web technologies and work on side projects to gain some experience.","In September 2020, we met Hemanth, a friend of a friend, who had the skills we needed and was interested in becoming an entrepreneur. We collaborated and started doing small projects for money. We rented office space, registered our firm officially and worked hard to earn enough to cover expenses. We quickly realized the importance of marketing and networking to get more projects. With our diverse set of skills, each one of us worked on multiple tasks, ranging from frontend and backend development, UI designing, content writing, marketing, strategy planning, user acquisition planning, and learning new technologies for improvements.","It was not easy. There were times when we doubted ourselves and our abilities. We poured our hearts and souls into our work, often staying up late and working weekends. But we never gave up. We recruited interns and remote employees to work on various projects. Our hard work paid off, and we landed a project worth INR 2 Lakhs in 2020. Even though the amount is not big enough for an entire team, this gave us the motivation to keep going.","With enough skills required to develop our app, we continued with our idea of a platform that aimed to connect skilled people with those in need of their services. This platform was designed to bring together students and freelancers with exceptional skills in areas like PC repairs, AC repairs, tutoring, web development, carpentry, and more, with customers in need of these services. However, we faced a major setback in early 2021, as we failed to keep up with the times and enter the market at the right time.","After this event, we decided to shift our focus towards providing mobile and web applications for clients, as we realized that having technical skills alone wasn’t enough to establish a startup. We also recognized the importance of developing soft skills such as networking, managing people, and leadership skills. As a team, we knew we had to evolve to stay relevant and successful.","We continued to learn and grow, improving our skills and expanding our network. We developed relationships with people who believed in our vision and worked tirelessly to deliver the best results. In 2021, we earned INR 2.5 lakhs from our projects, which was a significant milestone. It gave us the confidence to keep moving forward.","We were thinking of a unique approach to approach our clients. To cope up with advanced technologies, Hemanth began learning web3 to add a more advanced tech stack to our team. Hemanth, who was already a cybersecurity enthusiast and bug bounty hunter, conducted an experiment to find new clients. He performed ethical hacking on an application and informed the company about the bug. We then proposed our services to the company, and it worked! We secured three crucial projects in 2022 from this single company, including our first web3 project. The combined worth of these 3 projects is INR 6 lakhs.","It is during one of these projects, we got an abundance of positive responses from users praising our UI designs. Naveen’s creative work helped in attracting more clients.","While these projects were ongoing, we stumbled upon a new idea based on web3. Sekhar remembered an event from his college days where a student manipulated his academic credentials to land a job. That sparked the idea for a blockchain-based academic verification system. We worked hard on this idea, and with our advanced technology and soft skills, we shifted our office to a startup accelerator, Au-hub incubation center — Vizag, where we were exposed to an abundance of opportunities.","We developed prototypes of our new idea and pitched them to mentors and supporters to get feedback. Based on the feedback, we redeveloped the system with extra features, and the result was Cypher-b — a pre-verification and pre-interview-based blockchain platform. With Cypher-b, we aim to verify and interview job seekers and connect them with recruiters to make the recruitment process easy for companies and job seekers alike.","urrently, we are managing two distinct but equally promising firms. The first is Cypher-b, a cutting-edge HR tech solutions platform that offers businesses and organizations an array of innovative tools to streamline their human resource management processes. The second firm we manage is Spotmies, a web and mobile application development company with a special focus on Web3 technologies. Spotmies offers customized solutions that leverage blockchain and decentralized applications to create unparalleled user experiences. Together, these two firms represent our commitment to harnessing the power of technology to drive innovation and transformation in a rapidly evolving business landscape.","The journey to where we are today has been a rollercoaster ride, filled with highs and lows, successes, and failures. But, as a team, we have persevered and evolved to become the best versions of ourselves. We know that the road ahead won’t be easy, but we are ready to face any challenges that come our way."],
